# MathSucks
This is my first Android App - It is a simple App which gives the Percent provided of a Number

This is my first app which I build during my journey to Android Development and there are more to come :) 

# HOW DOES IT WORK?

This app being a very very simple doesnt have much of a working.. When the button is pressed, It grabs the data from Percentage Text Field and Number Field and safely unwraps them as
Strings then convert them into Float.

Then It Divides the Percentage number by 100 and then multiplies it with the Number from the 'Number Field' and outputs the Result on the totalText Label.
